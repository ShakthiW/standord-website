          <p>
            In the fast-paced airline industry, Fits Air sought an innovative
            way to streamline the booking experience, reduce friction in
            customer interactions, and deliver a seamless end-to-end travel
            service. Traditional online booking platforms require customers to
            navigate multiple pages, leading to drop-offs and a less
            personalized experience. Fits Air aimed to elevate customer service
            by creating a more intuitive, conversational booking process
            accessible within a single chat interface.

        <Section title="Proposed Solution">
          <p>
            We collaborated with Fits Air to develop an AI-powered chatbot that
            enables users to complete the entire booking process within a chat
            interface. The chatbot integrates with Fits Air’s APIs to deliver
            real-time flight information, destination searches, filtering
            options, and secure payment processing, creating a frictionless
            experience. This solution also includes:

              <strong>Personalized Travel Experience:</strong> Using data from
              frequent travelers, the chatbot tailors recommendations and
              remembers user preferences, delivering a highly personalized
              booking journey.

            <li>
              <strong>Travel Guidance and Recommendations:</strong> Powered by a
