            Our client needed a scalable, AI-driven solution to improve customer
            support efficiency and increase outreach effectiveness. Traditional
            customer support and outreach methods are often time-intensive,
            leading to delays, while requiring significant manual intervention.
            Our client aimed to enhance response times, personalize customer
            interactions, and streamline outreach efforts, ultimately improving
            customer satisfaction and driving engagement.
